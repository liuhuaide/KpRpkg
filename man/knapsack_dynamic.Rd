\usage{
knapsack_dynamic(x, W)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame containing two columns: 'v' (values) and 'w' (weights) of the items.
Both 'v' and 'w' must be positive numbers.}

\item{W}{A numeric value representing the maximum allowed weight in the knapsack.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
- \code{value}: The maximum total value obtained within the weight limit.
- \code{elements}: A sorted vector of indices indicating which items are included in the optimal solution.
}
\description{
This function solves the knapsack problem using dynamic programming.
Given a data frame of items, where each item has a value (\code{v}) and a weight (\code{w}),
it returns the maximum total value that can be obtained without exceeding the
specified weight limit \code{W}. It also identifies which items contribute to this maximum value.
