\usage{
greedy_knapsack(x, W)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame containing two columns: 'v' (values) and 'w' (weights) of the items.
Both 'v' and 'w' must be positive numbers.}

\item{W}{A numeric value representing the maximum allowed weight in the knapsack.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
- \code{value}: The total value obtained by the selected items.
- \code{elements}: A vector of indices indicating which items were selected for the knapsack.
}
\description{
This function solves the fractional knapsack problem using a greedy approach.
Given a data frame of items, where each item has a value (\code{v}) and a weight (\code{w}),
it selects items based on the highest value-to-weight ratio until the weight limit \code{W} is reached.
This approach may not always provide the optimal solution for the 0/1 knapsack problem,
but it is efficient.
